      'Probabilistic Analysis of Property Uncertainties Using Resin Infusion Flow Modeling and Simulations â€“ Resin Viscosity And Preform Permeability',
    description: `For LCM processes modeling and optimization substantial amount of research and work has been done. Several researches have been done based one-dimensional mold filling models, thin-shell molds, and three-dimensional models that simulate the mold filling, and heat transfer and curing stages. The objective of this work is to study the two key parameters: preform permeability and resin viscosity in liquid composite molding.`,
